# Tip Calculator

This is a Tip Calculator. It's really basic as it's my first real project. I'm still learning JavaScript but it should get better with time.

* Right now, it's only for smartphones. I'm planning to update it for tablets and desktop eventually.

### Random Stuff 

The formula used in this tip calculator is from my math class. It helps to know a little math, to be honest. 

### Basic Information

The function tipCalc() does the formula and returns the value and allCalc does the heavy lifiting and puts everything in the appropriate divs. 

init() function is self-explanatory.
